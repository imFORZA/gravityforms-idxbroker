== Description ==
Integrates Gravity Forms with IDX Broker allowing form submissions to be automatically sent to your IDX Broker account. 

Currently when enabled this plugin will attempt to create a lead in IDX Broker for any form that contains emails, phone, address. The form must have at least the email field in order for a lead to be created. It will also create a password for the submitter, and send them an email with login information they can use to access IDX to save properties and searches.
